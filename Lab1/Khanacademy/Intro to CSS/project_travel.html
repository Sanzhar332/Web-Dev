The cities of <strong>Barcelona</strong> and <strong>Madrid</strong> are of course <em>must-dos</em>. Don’t miss visiting the Alhambra fortress in Granda, Andalusia. Take a Flamenco class or learn to cook authentic Spanish cuisine. If possible, coincide your visit with one of Spain’s many festivals – La Tomatina, Tenerife Carnival or the famous Encierro or running of the <em>bulls</em>. </p>

The rules require participants to be at least 18 years old, run in the same direction as the bulls, not incite the bulls, and not be under the influence of alcohol.It is the one of the reasons why you need to visit Spain. </p>
