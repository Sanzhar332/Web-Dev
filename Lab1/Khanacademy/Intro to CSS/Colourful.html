        <p>Sharks are fishes and most have the typical fusiform body shape. Like other fishes, sharks are ectothermic (cold-blooded), live in water, have fins, and breathe with gills. However, sharks differ from Osteichthyes fish. One difference is that a shark's skeleton is made of cartilage instead of bone.</p>
        
        
        <p>The <em>shark</em> is awesome because <strong>do not have bones</strong>.</p>
